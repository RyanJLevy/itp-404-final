      "description": "A knee bar is a maneuver in which a climber cams their knee against a blocky, cracky, or roofy feature. This often allows the climber to hang freely without the use of one or both of their hands. This then allows them to rest in the middle of a route and regain some expended strength. Beyond recovery, a knee bar can also extend a climber's reach. Similar to a drop knee, a knee bar can work to rotate a climber's hips closer to the wall and thus extend their reach potential. Overall, this maneuver requires both leg and core strength as well as a keen awareness of the features of a given block.",
